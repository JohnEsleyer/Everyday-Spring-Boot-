This application is annotated with @SpringBootApplication, which enables Spring Boot's 
auto-configuration and component scanning features. It also has
a @RestController annotation, which indicates that it is a controller class that
that handles incoming HTTP requests and return responses.

The main method uses Spring Boots SpringApplication.run method to
launch the application. It also has a @GetMapping annotation on the getNotes
method, which maps it to the /notes URL and specifies that it should handle 
HTTP GET requests. This method returns a list of all the notes that have been
created.

The addNote method is annotated with @PostMapping, which specifies that it should handle
HTTP POST requests and maps it to the /notes URL. It also has a RequestBody
annotation, which indicates that the request body should be deserialized into a Note 
object and passed as an argument to the method. 
This method adds the new note to the list of notes. 

Overall, this Spring Boot application exposes a simple REST API for
creating and retrieving notes. It uses annotations to specify the HTTP method
and URL that each method should handle, and uses the @RequestBody annotation to
deserialize request bodies into objects.
